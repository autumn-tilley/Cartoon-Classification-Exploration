CLASSIFYING

cd into the classification-code directory

In order to run the scene classification model enter the following into the terminal:
python run.py --task 1 --data ../15_Scene

In order to run the cartoon-or-not classification model enter the following into the terminal:
FOR OUR OWN CUSTOM MODEL: python run.py --task 2 --data ../cartoon-or-not
FOR VGG BASED MODEL: python run.py --task 3 --data ../cartoon-or-not

You can also test on a single image. Modify the image path as desired:
To classify into one of the 15 scenes: python run.py --task 4 --data ../15_Scene --imagePath ../15_Scene/test/Office/image_0001.jpg

To classify into cartoon-or-not using custom "your" model: python run.py --task 5 --data ../cartoon-or-not --imagePath ../cartoon-or-not/test/cartoon/image_0001.jpg

To classify into cartoon-or-not using custom VGG model: python run.py --task 6 --data ../cartoon-or-not --imagePath ../cartoon-or-not/test/cartoon/image_0001.jpg



APPLYING FILTERS

Cd into the filter-code directory

Based on the input for "--task", you can apply either a "cartoon" or an "edge" filter. Or both.

Based on the input for "--quantity", you can either apply a filter to a "single" image or to "many" images." For a single image, paste in the pathway to the image for the "--image" argument. For many images, paste in the pathway to a folder of folders of images for the "--image" argument.
